Hello,

Please open the terminal and run: "npm test".
I've added test cases, but I could have done more:

Created page object models: storing locators in a JavaScript file for reuse.
Integrated Cucumber: wrote feature files, test cases, and acceptance criteria, generating a Cucumber report (or a normal report).
Implemented performance testing: wrote loops to test how many todo lists the application can handle.
And much more...

For more information about me, please visit my webpage: kemalorhan.com.

Many thanks
Kind regards
