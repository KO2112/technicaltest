# To Do App Exercise

Please complete the exercise by implementing a complete set of playwright tests for the To-Do Application.

The To-Do Application maintains a list of items you may want to complete later. You can add items, remove items, mark items as completed, and filter the items.

## Getting started

This all requires node. Once installed it can be tested using the following commands.

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
npx playwright test
```

### Run the Playwright UI

The playwright UI can be started with the following command.

```bash
npm test
```

### Start the To Do App

The To Do app can be started independently using the command:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npx http-server -o
```


Hello,

Please open the terminal and run: "npm test".
I've added test cases, but I could have done more:

Created page object models: storing locators in a JavaScript file for reuse.
Integrated Cucumber: wrote feature files, test cases, and acceptance criteria, generating a Cucumber report (or a normal report).
Implemented performance testing: wrote loops to test how many todo lists the application can handle.
And much more...

Many thanks
Kind regards
